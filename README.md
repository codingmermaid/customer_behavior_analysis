Utilizing Cluster Analysis to segmentate customers with K-means clustering

<h1>Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering</h1>h1>
Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By analyzing customer data, we identify meaningful groups (clusters) to help businesses understand their customers better, enabling targeted marketing strategies, improved customer satisfaction, and optimized business operations.

<h2>Key Objectives</h2>

<ul>

<li>Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.</li>
<li>Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.</li>
<li>Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their attributes.</li>
<li>Interpret and visualize the resulting clusters for actionable insights.</li>

</ul>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.</li>
    <li>Addressed missing values and standardized features for clustering.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Visualized distributions, correlations, and relationships between key features.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Optimal Cluster Determination:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Used the Elbow Method to identify the best value for <code>K</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Clustering:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.</li>
    <li>Visualized clusters using scatter plots and pair plots.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Cluster Interpretation:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyzed cluster profiles to describe key characteristics of each segment.</li>
  </ul>
